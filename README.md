# Basic-ChatGPT-CLI
Minimalistic, functional Python3 CLI for ChatGPT api usage. Too many requests have flooded websites like UPWork for something this basic with people offering as much as $50.00 USD. That being said, I send my clients this repo to save time, communication, &amp; money. This is not meant to replace your usage of the standard browser UI of ChatGPT, as this is just a very basic prototype that works with the current OpenAI API using Python3 for anyone to experiment with.
